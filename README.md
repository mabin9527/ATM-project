## Description
----------------------------------------

ATM project is based on the Python language. Users can open an account, lodge and withdraw money and check their account balance by selecting the ATM menu. All data can be read or saved to google sheets. The live site can be found [here](https://atm-project.herokuapp.com/).

### Lucidchart
----------------------------------------

For a logical statement of the ATM project, a lucidchart has been used to explain the working process of the machine clearly. Besides, it assists me with logical guidance to complete the project.
